Hello World! Generative Art can mean a lot of things, but today, for
us, it means using computers to help use explore the aesthetics of
systems! What the heck does that mean? 

Consider nature, for instance:

![The Wave](https://vincenttoups.github.io/ux-iron-yard/the-wave.jpg)

What we find so striking about these sorts of natural displays is at
least in part an appreciation that they represent the repeated
application of cyclical forces (in the above case, evaporation and
replenishment of water, probably) over very long times to produce. The
rock has become an intricate record cycles of water and wind in the
area.

Computers allow us to simulate such cycles and systems at great speed,
and if we connect those simulations to visualizations of some kind, we
can often produce similarly intricate records or expressions of those
processes. If we carefully balance order and disorder, we can produce
very aesthetically pleasing results.

Why Should I Learn to Do This?
==============================

Generative art is a pleasing artistic endeavor regardless of practical
benefits, but it also is a very good opportunity to become familiar
with technical tools in a context which encourages experimentation and
creativity, a context where even errors may open fruitful avenues of
exploration. 

Ultimately, (and particularly for developers working on the front
end), all our technical skills require an element of creativity and an
understanding of human beings. A portfolio of generative art can give
potential employers a powerful argument that you have both technical
mastery and the creative ability to solve hard problems in a novel
way.

Why Javascript?
===============

Javascript is a uniquely powerful environment for creating generative
art because it is very easy to get started with (all you need is a
browser and a text editor) and it is extremely easy to deliver you art
work to its audience: everyone who has a computer has a web browser. 

Plus, Javascript is one of the world's most commonly used programming
languages, and while it has its famously documented warts, it is als
capable of elegance and agility. Generative art is a great way to get
comfortable with the language without the stress of a deliverable.
